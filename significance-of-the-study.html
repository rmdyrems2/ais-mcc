		 </center>
         <p>
            The purpose of this study in accounting information system (AIMS) is to collect, store,
            and process financial transactions and accounting data and produce informational reports
            that managers or other interested parties can use to make business decisions and
            accountants provide the information necessary to determine and evaluate the long term
            and short term financial stability of school, organization or individuals, but we are focusing
            the payments and billing in AIS. Accounting officer within any organization must use the
            accounting information system to accomplish the functions of accounting, generating
            transaction reports, and using accounting reports. For example, a controller in an
            organization must oversee a staff of accountants who record all accounting transactions,
            do the monthly closing of the accounting records, and generate the reports needed by
            management and external users. The accounting information system is the mechanism
            that allows the accounting staff to accomplish those functions. Accountants must therefore
            understand AIS concepts in order to perform these account
         </p>

            will provide improvements on the current accounting processes of the school.
            Specifically, the system will also be beneficial to the following:
