            AIMS have recently been asserted in many studies to play a constructive role in
strategy management, serving as a framework that allows organizational strategy to be
implemented (Chenhall, 2003; Gerdin and Greve, 2004). According to the researchers,
Miller (1992), Bledsoe (1997), Abernethy & Lilis (1995), and Choe (2002); non-financial
performance provides various strategic advantages, such as quality improvement and
cutting down the delivery time. Non-financial performance was used by Tuanmat & Smith
(2011) to measure organizational outcome, as with respect to product availability, product
quality, and sales service and support. Sousa, et al. (2006) also used productivity,
customer satisfaction, and customer needs to assess the company’s performance.
Furthermore, Isobe, et al. (2008) developed a list of long-term performance indicators,
including new product and technological innovations. In addition, there is a growing
literature on the use of non-financial measures in the West. For example, in the UK,
Bhimani (1994) and Dugdale (1994) wrote that companies were quite open to the use of
non-financial measures. According to Pierce & O’Dea (1998), over 50% of respondents in
Ireland ranked the use of non-financial measures as very frequent or often.
Furthermore,(Ittner & Larcker, 2003, p.95) looked into implementation issues for nonfinancial performance measures, and concluded by saying that “they have become a
shabby substitute for financial performance” and “they will offer little guidance unless the
process for choosing and analyzing them comes to rely less on generic performance
measurement frameworks and managerial guesswork and more on sophisticated
quantitative and qualitative inquiries into the factors actually contributing to economic
results”. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The shortfalls of outdated financial performance measures have steered
organizations towards embracing non-financial performance measures, nonetheless
these measures also have shortcomings(James L., 2007)These relate to the range of
non-financial performance measures, and the problem arising from choosing suitable
measures, given that there is no ideal mix of performance measures(Paul John Steinbart,
2008). Moreover, measuring organizations’ financial performance is intrinsically
straightforward, because there are rules and guidelines that define the financial
measures. On the other hand, non-financial performance measures cannot be subject to
the same rules or guidelines. (Leslie Turner, 2005) Still, the establishment of non-financial
performance measures should be related to the target settings, and rewards and
incentives also need to be reflected (Otley, 2001). Arguments in support of such subjective
measures also include difficulties with collecting qualitative performance data from firms
and with the reliability of such data arising from divergent accounting methods used by
firms (Andrea B. Weickgenannt,2005) 
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, using financial performance as a measure of the success or
failure of IS has various advantages (Antonio Pérez-Méndez & Ángel Machado-Cabezas,
2015). Among these, the fact that performance measurement is vital to the success of the
company because it creates understanding, forms behavior, and improves
competitiveness (Gunasegaran, Williams & McGaughey, 2005). Furthermore, financial
performance reflects a common objective of all the company’s IS and/or management
processes, which makes it simpler to access their service. Lastly, despite their limitations,
financial data has the advantage of being accurate and objective (Parker, 2000), while
intermediary, non-financial aims are often subjective, since they rely on personal opinions.
Therefore, the assessment of non-financial aims may rely on the job held by the
respondent (Anderson & Young, 1999). Branch (2000) maintains that financial indicators
based on accounting information are adequate enough to determine the value for
shareholders. A manufacturing firm financial performance is directly impacted by its
position in the market. Profitability can be decomposed into its two key components,
namely its net turnover and its net profit margin. Ross et al. (1996) argues that both can
influence the profitability of a company one time. If a high turnover indicates the improved
use of the assets its and therefore higher efficiency, a higher profit margin means that the
entity has marked market power. Menon & Williams (1994) found out that, objective
performance measures comprise indicators such as profit growth, revenue growth, as well
as return on the capital employed.

            According to Pizzey (2009), a balance sheet is a vital aspect of financial statements
because it depicts a company's financial status at a certain point in time and contrasts the
assets of the company with the liabilities or sources of funds used to finance those assets. 
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Njau (2006), a company with positive cash inflows over outflows is
financially strong because it will most likely be able to fulfill its potential repayment
obligations and will have ample surplus funds to be flexible in its future operations. The
relationship between cash flow and solvency has provided valuable insight into financial
success. Accounting, according to Warren et al. (2005), is an information system that
generates data for interested parties regarding economic operations and company results.
Accounting's main goal is to include facts that can be used to make decisions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Accounting, in other words, is a data-gathering operation. According also to Warren
et al. (2005), the aim of accounting is to generate information that managers can use to
operate their businesses. Accounting also provides information about a company's
economic results and financial status to a variety of stakeholders. The task of accounting,
according to (Considine et al. 2010), is to collect data about a business's operations,
provide a medium for data storage and processing, and then turn the data into useful
information. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The staff, processes, technology, and documents used by a company to (1)
produce accounting information and (2) convey this information to decision makers make
up an accounting system
(Williams, Haka, Bettner, & Carcello, 2008). The types of accounting information needed
are determined by the management's business decisions. It means that the role of
accounting information is to assist managers in making business decisions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            unting information is to assist managers in making business decisions.
Accounting information has evolved over the ages with humanity, from the
exchange of goods (Trade-by-barter) using symbols and cowries to record keeping
practices, with today's people of all civilizations keeping different forms of business
records. The day tablets, which date from around 3600BC and record the payment of
wages in Babylonia, are the oldest known (Copper Harris, 2006). In ancient Egypt and the
Greek city states, there are various examples of record keeping and accounting control
systems (North Gall, 2004)
