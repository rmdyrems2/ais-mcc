					Rationale of the Study
				 </h2>
			</center>
			
			<p>
			   The capstone project <b>“Accounting Information Management System”</b> will streamline the process of tracking and keeping financial records of a School, The said project will manage the records of expenses, invoices and other financial transactions of the school or organization.
			</p>
			<p>
			   Currently, many school or organization uses a manually-aided system in managing their financial transactionsand records. The manual method of accounting is prone to human errors and will not let the company effectively assess their financial situation. Records of expenses and invoices may not be accurate and reliable due to possible human errors especially in the manual calculation of digits. The manual process is thought to be inefficient and ineffective in preparing prompt financial reports. Organizations are in need of an automated system that will assist them to efficiently manage their overall financial activities.
			</p>
			<p>
			   The technique and directions of an <b>AIMS</b> are the strategies it utilizes for gathering, putting away, recovering, and preparing information. These strategies are both manual and robotized. The information can emerge out of both inside sources (e.g., workers) and outside sources (e.g., clients’ online orders). Methodology and directions will be coded into the <b>AIS</b> programming. Notwithstanding, the methodology and guidelines ought to likewise be “coded” into representatives through documentation and preparing. The strategies and directions should be followed reliably to be successful.
			</p>
			<p>
			   The information can be utilized to plan accounting explanations and monetary reports, including money due aging, depreciation or amortization plans, a trial balance, and a benefit and misfortune proclamation. Having the entirety of this information in one spot—in the <b>AIMS</b>—encourages a business’ record-continuing, revealing, investigation, reviewing, and dynamic exercises. For the information to be helpful, it should be finished, precise, and applicable.  
			</p>
			<p>
			   The researchers of the study proposed an automated accounting management system in order to resolve the aforementioned issues encountered in the manual method. The proposed system will allow electronic accounting management where records of financial transactions will be processed electronically. The said project will keep the financial records and transactions accurate, reliable, safe and secure. The proposed system will eliminate the paper works and other difficulties encountered in the manual process.
