			Due to the weakness of the mechanized accounting information management system, it is not difficult

			certain strategies to address the major issues. As indicated by American Institute of CPAs in request to
			shield the business association from the assault of danger and security dangers, TOP Technology
			Initiatives Task Force, which is a gathering of the innovatively adroit individuals from the CPA calling and
			other innovation experts, worked together in the group, trying to distinguish the main innovation
			activities.

		 <p>
			The primary strategy is improving the data security, for example, overhaul the equipment and
			programming to shield the data frameworks from the security dangers. Organization should execute and
			redesign the degree of firewall which obstructs the interruption from the web. Update the counter
			infection programs with the logins of secret phrase and username to restrict access.
			Other than that, organization should enlist the accomplished organization integrator to check whether it
			is work appropriately with the security patches. Furthermore, organization can have a security review
			for the free affirmation on the organization’s monetary information and customer’s data. Through this
			interaction, business association can be ensured.

			The other strategy is fiasco and business coherence arranging. It is an action which includes in the
			creating, checking and refreshing of the environmental change, mishap and other vindictive annihilation.
			It can forestall the business association to misfortune their significant data. It is on the grounds that
			having the electronic accounting information management system, down for not many hours or few
			days because of the cataclysmic event; could lead a terrible effect on the benefit and liquidity of the
			business association. In this way, business association should plan and plan a cycle to keep the system
			stable to forestall any misfortunes.
