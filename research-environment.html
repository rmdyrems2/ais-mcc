            The Mandaue City College (MCC) is a government-recognized higher education
institution in Mandaue, Philippines, established for deserving students, mostly graduates from
barangay high schools, who have no access to education in mainstream private colleges or
universities. The school was established by the Local Government of Mandaue through
Ordinance No. 10-2005-324A, enacted by the 10th Sangguniang Panlungsod on September 27,
2005. This ordinance was later revised on October 7, 2010 pursuant to SP Ordinance No. 12-2010-568. Mandaue City College right now is in need with this kind of system because they are
still using the manual way and we, as the student of the school wants the best of our institution.
<h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING METHODOLOGY
</h3>
<p>The methodology of this project is Descriptive Method and Traditional SDLC. This
    methodology was designed in the late 1960s and it had a great impact on the data processing
    community. The phases of this methodology are the following:
    </p>

    <ol class="re-list" id="cause-and-fx">
        <li>Requirements Analysis</li>
        <li>System Design</li>
        <li>Implementation</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Deployment</li>
        <li>Maintenance</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The model we used was the Waterfall Model which is an illustration of a plan-driven process- in
principle.
    </p>
    <h3>
        REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS AND PLANNING PHASE

    </h3>
    <p>
        This system aims for the work in the office to be much easier. The finance team in the
school are really having a hard time, as the researchers recommends the best for them.
