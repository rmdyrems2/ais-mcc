    <h3>Information System</h3>
    <p>
        Information system is a set of interrelated subsystems that work together to Collect,
        process, store, transform, and distribute information for planning, decisions Making and
        controlling (Pol & Lim, 2013). The use of computer in information Systems can improve
        the efficiency of information collection, process, store, transform and distribute (James Hall,
        2012).In addition, accounting information system (AIS) is a tool which was incorporated
        in the field of Information and Technology systems Accounting information system is very
        important for business entities. Emphasizing the AIS the transaction part is a very
        important to an accounting information system (Oracle, 2017). Transactions includes
        billing and payment features such as viewing and paying a bill, reviewing payment history,
        and selecting billing and payment options such as paperless billing (CFI, 2017. Links are
        available to customers to take common billing actions such as viewing more details about
        their current bill, comparing previous bills, exploring their energy use, and changing their
        utility account communication preferences. (David Storm, 2001). The effectiveness of an
        information system’s controls is evaluated through an information systems audit. An audit
        aims to establish whether information systems are safeguarding corporate assets,
        maintaining the integrity of stored and communicated data, supporting corporate
        objectives effectively, and operating efficiently. It is a part of a more general financial audit
        that verifies an organization’s accounting and financial statements (Clark Monton,2008).
        Information systems are designed so that every financial transaction can be traced. In
        other words, an audit trail must exist that can establish where each transaction originated
        and how it was processed. Aside from financial audits, operational audits are used to
        evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of information systems operations, and
        technological audits verify that information technologies are appropriately chosen,
        configured, and implemented(Bratanica,2015)

        Essential organizational capabilities are enabled or enhanced by information
systems. These systems provide support for business operations; for individual and group
decision making; for innovation through new product and process development; for
relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners; for pursuit of competitive
advantage; and, in some cases, for the business model itself (e.g., Google). Information
systems bring new options to the way companies interact and compete, the way
organizations are structured, and the way workplaces are designed. In general, use of
Web-based information systems can significantly lower the costs
of communication among workers and firms and cost-effectively enhance the
coordination of supply chains or webs. This has led many organizations to concentrate on
their core competencies and to outsource other parts of their value chain to specialized
companies. The capability to communicate information efficiently within a firm has led to
the deployment of flatter organizational structures with fewer hierarchical layers. (James
Hall, 2009) Nevertheless, information systems do not uniformly lead to higher profits.
Success depends both on the skill with which information systems are deployed and on
their use being combined with other resources of the firm, such as relationships with
business partners or superior knowledge in the industrial segment. Computerized
information systems, particularly since the arrival of the Web and mobile computing, have
had a profound effect on organizations, economies, and societies, as well as on
individuals whose lives and activities are conducted in these social aggregates(Norman
Cast,2002).

        The use of information systems has enabled new organizational structures. In
particular, so-called virtual organizations have emerged that do not rely on physical offices
and standard organizational charts. Two notable forms of virtual organizations are the
network organization and the cluster organization. In a network organization, long-term
corporate partners supply goods and services through a central hub firm. Together, a
network of relatively small companies can present the appearance of a large corporation.
Indeed, at the core of such an organization may be nothing more than a
single entrepreneur supported by only a few employees. Thus, network organization
forms a flexible ecosystem of companies, whose formation and work is organized around
Web-based information systems(Erick ,2007). In a cluster organization, the principal work
units are permanent and temporary teams of individuals with complementary skills. Team
members, who are often widely dispersed around the globe, are greatly assisted in their
work by the use of Web resources, corporate intranets, and collaboration systems. Global
virtual teams are able to work around the clock, moving knowledge work electronically “to
follow the sun.” Information systems delivered over mobile platforms have enabled
employees to work not just outside the corporate offices but virtually anywhere. “Work is
the thing you do, not the place you go to” became the slogan of the emerging new
workplace. Virtual workplaces include home offices, regional work centers,
customers’ premises, and mobile offices of people such as insurance adjusters.
Employees who work in virtual workplaces outside their company’s premises are known
as teleworker (Lauron Mitts,2005). The role of consumers has changed, empowered by
the Web. Instead of being just passive recipients of products, they can actively participate
with the producers in the cocreation of value. By coordinating their collective work using
information systems, individuals created such products as open-source software and
online encyclopedia’s. The value of virtual worlds and massively multiplayer online
games has been created largely by the participants. The electronic word-of-mouth in the
form of reviews and opinions expressed on the Web can make or break products. In
sponsored cocreation, companies attract their customers to generate and evaluate ideas,
codevelop new products, and promote the existing goods and services. Virtual
customer communities are created online for these purposes.(Arthur
Segt,2003).Individual privacy hinges on the right to control one’s personal information.
While invasion of privacy is generally perceived as an undesirable loss of autonomy,
government and business organizations do need to collect data in order
to facilitate administration and exploit sales and marketing opportunities. Electronic
commerce presents a particular challenge to privacy, as personal information is routinely
collected and potentially disseminated in a largely unregulated manner.(Robert
Degallies,2011)The ownership of and control over the personal profiles, contacts, and
communications in social networks are one example of a privacy issue that awaits
resolution through a combination of market forces, industry self-regulation, and possibly
government regulation. Preventing invasions of privacy is complicated by the lack of an
international legal standard. Intellectual property, such as software, books, music, and
movies, is protected, albeit imperfectly, by patents, trade secrets, and copyrights.
However, such intangible goods can be easily copied and transmitted electronically over
the Web for unlawful reproduction and use. Combinations of legal statutes and
technological safeguards, including antipiracy encryption and electronic watermarks, are
in place, but much of the abuse prevention relies on the ethics of the user. The means of
protection themselves, such as patents, play a great role in the information society.
However, the protection of business methods (e.g., Amazon’s patenting of one-click
ordering) is being questioned, and the global enforcement of intellectual property
protection encounters various challenges.(Efy Ozy,2008).

        Access to information systems over the Web is necessary for full participation in
modern society. In particular, it is desirable to avoid the emergence of digital divides
between nations or regions and between social and ethnic groups (Karen Wager,2017).
Open access to the Web as a medium for human communication and as a repository for
shared knowledge is treasured. Indeed, many people consider free speech a universal
human right and the Internet and Web the most widely accessible means to exercise that
right. Yet, legitimate concerns arise about protecting children without resorting to
censorship. Technological solutions, such as software that filters out pornography and
inappropriate communications, are partially successful. Of concern to everyone is the
accuracy and security of information contained in databases and data warehouses—
whether in health and insurance data, credit bureau records, or government files—as
misinformation or privileged information released inappropriately can adversely affect
personal safety, livelihood, and everyday life. Individuals must cooperate in reviewing and
correcting their files, and organizations must ensure appropriate security, access to, and
use of such files (John Glaser,2015). Information systems have affected the quality of
personal and working lives. In the workplace, information systems can be deployed to
eliminate tedious tasks and give workers greater autonomy, or they can be used to
thoughtlessly eliminate jobs and subject the remaining workforce to pervasive electronic
surveillance. Consumers can use the Web for shopping, networking, and entertainment—
but at the risk of contending with spam (unsolicited e-mail), interception of credit
card numbers, and attack by computer viruses.(Nanett Sayles,2008).
